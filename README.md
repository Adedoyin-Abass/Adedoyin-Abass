## ðŸ”­ My Top Projects
* **Built a Password Manager** - This was my very first project, and I made it intending to use Fernet (symmetric key) to keep the password and RSA (asymmetric key) to ensure safe exchange of the symmetric key.  [Link to Project 1](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/Password_Manager)
* **Built a Network Sniffer** - The network sniffer sniffs Ethernet frames, IPv4 TCP, ICMP. and UDP data packets [Link to Project 2](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/PRODIGY_CS_01)
* **Built a Caesar Cipher** - My favorite feature is the custom feature that allows users to input their shift value. [Link to Project 3](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/codealpha_tasks_networksniffer)
