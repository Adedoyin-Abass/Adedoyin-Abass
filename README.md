# Hi there, I'm Adedoyin AbassðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Cyber Security Analyst with a focus on securing data and assets. I love building security tools and exploring new technologies like cryptographic tools, SIEM tools, and Networking tools

## ðŸŒ± Skills
* Incident Response: Log analysis (Splunk, ELK Stack), incident handling
* Threat Intelligence: MITRE ATT&CK mapping
* SOC Operations: SIEM (Splunk, QRadar basics), network monitoring (Wireshark & TCPDump)
* Static & Dynamic Malware Analysis: Debugging, Sandboxing, Reverse Engineering
* Scripting: Python, Bash
* Frameworks: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53
* Tools: Wireshark, Nessus, Splunk, Volatility

## ðŸ”­ My Top Projects
* **[Built a Password Manager tool](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/Password_Manager)** - For my very first project, I built a system designed to use Fernet (symmetric-key encryption) for data protection, securing information with a key (potentially derived from a password). I also incorporated RSA (asymmetric-key encryption) to ensure the safe exchange of this symmetric key.
* **[Built a Network Sniffer](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/codealpha_tasks_network_sniffer)** - The network sniffer sniffs `Ethernet frames`, `IPv4`, `ICMP`, `TCP`, and `UDP` data packets.
* **[Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/PRODIGY_CS_01)** - My favorite feature is the custom feature that allows users to input their shift value.
*  **[Block-Oriented Image Security tool](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/PRODIGY_CS_02)** - My favorite feature of this code is its perfect reversibility, which relies on the key generated and used by the `block_scramble` function.
*  **[Developed XOR-based image manipulation tools](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/xor_image_manipulation)** - The encryption algorithm makes use of XOR operations to obscure the relationship between the plaintext (original image) and the ciphertext (scrambled image) by mixing bits.
