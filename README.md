# Hi there, I'm Adedoyin AbassðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Cyber Security Analyst with a focus on securing data and assets. I love building security tools and exploring new technologies like cryptographic tools, SIEM tools, and Networking tools

## ðŸŒ± Skills
* Incident Response: Log analysis (Splunk, ELK Stack), incident handling
* Threat Intelligence: MITRE ATT&CK mapping
* SOC Operations: SIEM (Splunk, QRadar basics), network monitoring (Wireshark & TCPDump)
* Static & Dynamic Malware Analysis: Debugging, Sandboxing, Reverse Engineering
* Scripting: Python, Bash
* Frameworks: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53
* Tools: Wireshark, Nessus, Splunk, Volatility

## ðŸ”­ My Top Projects
* **Designed a Password Manager** - This was my very first project, and I made it intending to use Fernet (symmetric key) to keep the password and RSA (asymmetric key) to ensure safe exchange of the symmetric key.  [Link to Project 1](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/Password_Manager)
* **Built a Network Sniffer** - The network sniffer sniffs Ethernet frames, IPv4 TCP, ICMP. and UDP data packets [Link to Project 2](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/PRODIGY_CS_01)
* **Built a Caesar Cipher** - My favorite feature is the custom feature that allows users to input their shift value. [Link to Project 3](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/codealpha_tasks_networksniffer)
*  **Designed and Implemented a Block-Oriented Image Security tool** -  My favourite feature of this code is that its perfect reversibility is enabled by the generated key file using the `block_scramble` function. [Link to Project 4](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/PRODIGY_CS_01)
*  **Developed XOR-based image manipulation tools** - The encryption algorithm makes use of XOR operations to obscure the relationship between the plaintext (original image) and the ciphertext (scrambled image) by mixing bits.[Link to Project 5](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Dekiru/xor_image_manipulation)
